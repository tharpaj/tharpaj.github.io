<title>Welcome to Aubrey Tharp's Website</title>

Hello everyone, my name is Aubrey Tharp. I live in St. Charles, MO with my husband and two kids. I have been teaching for 14 years, and I am getting ready to enter my 10th year teaching kindergarten. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I began teaching my kinders online using Google Sites. I put together the website along with the content included for each week. I have created other classroom websites through Google Sites. I've also used Weebly to connect with families during a unit we did on hatching chickens in the classroom. I do not have any real experience with HTML or CSS, and I am excited to learn more. Through this course, I am hoping to learn how to build a website from the ground up. This would allow me have more freedom when creating websites for my classroom. I enjoy spending time with my family, and I am really into crafting. Eventually, I would like to set up a website to showcase the things that I create.
