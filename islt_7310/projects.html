        <h3>Goal 1</h3>
        <p>To provide students with experiences to develop theory-grounded and research-based competencies for the innovative, aesthetic, effective, and sustainable design/development and management of technologies for learning opportunities and systems.</p>
        <h4>Artifact 1: Technology in the K-5 Classroom to Enhance Student Learning Teacher Workshop (Instructional Systems Design)</h4>
        <p class="artifact"><a href="docs/finalproject.pdf" target="_blank">Technology in the K-5 Classroom to Enhance Student Learning Teacher Workshop</a></p>
        <h4>Objectives Met:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective 1.1: Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.</li>
                <li>Objective 1.2: Students are able to design/develop learning opportunities and systems for
                meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners.</li>
                <li>Objective 1.3: Students are able to conduct project management activities for both
                design/development, and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Description of Artifact:</h4>
        <p>This artifact is a three-day training that five other students and I developed and designed for the course, Instructional Systems Design. In this training, K-5 classroom teachers will gain strategies and tools to immediately incorporate meaningful technology into their classrooms.</p>
        
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>This project was my first big assignment for my EdSp program. We divided up the assignment and each had different parts that we worked on. We used Google Docs, which allowed us to view everyone's part and make suggestions and changes as each of us worked. We communicated through the Canvas message tool, texts, and even on Google Meet. We had a lot of diverse grade levels, which allowed our project to be more diverse and fit with teachers from all different grade levels K-5. This project made me realize how important it is to stay cognisent of your stakeholders and make sure you are meeting their needs and not the needs you impress upon them. Through Action Research Groups and trainings provided by my district, I see how parts of the different Instructional Design model work together.</p>

        <a id="top_goal2">Goal 2</a>
        <div class="section">
        <h3>Goal 2</h3>
        <p>To provide students with experiences to develop skills in data collection, analysis and evaluation for reflecting on and applying to the design/development of learning opportunities and systems.</p>
        <h4>Artifact 1: Writing Learning Objectives (Instructional Systems Design)</h4>

        <h4>Objectives Met:</h4> 
            
        <!--DELETE THE OBJECTIVES NOT MET BY THE ARTIFACT YOU WILL ADD HERE-->
            
            <ul>
                <li>Objective 1.1: Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Description of Artifact:</h4>
        <p>This artifact is learning objectives paired with assessments that was created based on a personal scenario for the course, Instructional Systems Design. The scenario is based on the social immaturity of kindergarteners and instruction being designed to help them utilized the zones of regulation to build communication skills and become more independent problem solvers.</p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>This was an interesting assignment, because I got to really look at what I teach. Breaking apart the objectives to determine if my assessments aligned with what I wanted students to get out of each lesson. One great thing about this assignment, is that I am actually able to use it in my classroom. This project made me realize how important it is to write clear objectives and to add how they will be measured.</p>

        <h3>Goal 3</h3>
        <p>To provide students with experiences to become socially responsible, reflective/sensitive on the interaction of technologies and society and act ethically in response to current and future challenges of emerging technologies for learning.</p>
        <h4>Artifact 1: Kindergarten Connect Website â€“ 2019-2020 Distance Learning</h4>
        <p class="artifact"><a href=https://sites.google.com/warrencor3.k12.mo.us/kdgconnect/home target="_blank">Kindergarten Connect Website</a></p>
        <h4>Objectives Met:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective 1.1: Students are able to design/develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, constructivist learning, collaborative work, and performance support.</li>

        <h4>Description of Artifact:</h4>
        <p> This artifact is a website I developed and designed to assist my students and parents through the last 9 weeks of school.</p>
        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>This website was created as a way for me to continue to teach my students even though we would no longer be able to learn in person. Through the creation of this site, I found ways to incorporate everyday learning activities for my students. I found it difficult to format the site to be exactly how I envisioned it, but I defintely go the job done. I enjoyed creating this website and I will continue to design and develop more sites similar to this to keep parents informed of what we are doing in class.</p>
