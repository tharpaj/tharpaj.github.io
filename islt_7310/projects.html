        <h4>Description of Artifact:</h4>
        <p>This artifact is learning objectives paired with assessments that was created based on a personal scenario for the course, Instructional Systems Design. The scenario is based on the social immaturity of kindergartens and instruction being designed to help them utilized the zones of regulation to build communication skills and become more independent problem solvers.</p>
